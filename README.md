## Summary
There are 7 different job titles that have employees retiring soon, with a total of 72,458 retirees. Out of all those retirees, 50842 of them (up to 70.17%) are holding senior positions. With the exisiting situation, there are 1549 qualified mentorship candidates, which is a much smaller group compared to the number of retirees. Based on the circumstances, Pewlett Hackard will need to invest in a lot to hire senior engineers and staff, with putting in heavy focus on developing existing employees to fastern their process to senior roles.
